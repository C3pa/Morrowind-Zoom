Description
____________

This mod allows you to zoom in. You can configure the mod's behavior in the Mod Configuration Menu. You can adjust maximal zoom,
zooming speed, and zoom key. You can zoom either by pressing a button (toggle functionality), by holding a button, or by using
the mouse scroll. You can select between these zoom modes in the MCM. In addition, you can optionally turn on the spyglass overlay
which is shown during zooming.

Modules description:
00 Core - Core Zoom mod.
01 Spyglass Items Required - With this module, the player needs to have a Spyglass item in inventory to be able to activate zoom.
                             It works with "Spyglass" item from Tamriel Data (and any mod using it such as Tamriel Rebuilt), and
                             Spyglass items from An Addendum to Tamrielic Lore Data (AATL Data)
02 AATL Data Spyglass Distributed - Adds Spyglass items from AATL Data to some traders and leveled lists. Goes hand in hand with module 01.
03 Hi-Res Overlay Texture - A more detailed overlay used when zoomed in. All the credits go to Fluffalicious for this one!

Modify my mod, but credit me as the original creator. If you are a modder looking to integrate this better into the game,
feel free to contact me. I'd like to give a hand, I am also interested in making working binoculars or spyglass with this
script.

1.0
Initial Release
1.1
Feature: Mod now allows binding combinations that include mouse buttons.
Bugfix: Prevent zooming with the scroll wheel while holding toggle POV (TAB by default). In Vanilla, while holding
        the TAB key, the scroll wheel controls the camera.

1.2.1
Feature: Made maximal Draw Distance customizable in the MCM.
1.3.0
Feature: Added a module that requires the player to have a spyglass item in inventory to zoom.

1.4.0
Feature: Added a Hi-Res version of overlay texture made by Fluffalicious.
