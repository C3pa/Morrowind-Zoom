Description
____________

This mod allows you to zoom in. You can configure the mod's behavior in the Mod Configuration Menu. You can adjust maximal zoom,
zooming speed, and zoom key. You can zoom either by pressing a button (toggle functionality), by holding a button, or by using
the mouse scroll. You can select between these zoom modes in the MCM. In addition, you can optionally turn on the spyglass overlay
which is shown during zooming.

Modify my mod, but credit me as the original creator. If you are a modder looking to integrate this better into the game,
feel free to contact me. I'd like to give a hand, I am also interested in making working binoculars or spyglass with this
script.

Initial Release

Feature: Mod now allows binding combinations that include mouse buttons.
Bugfix: Prevent zooming with the scroll wheel while holding toggle POV (TAB by default). In Vanilla, while holding
        the TAB key, the scroll wheel controls the camera.
