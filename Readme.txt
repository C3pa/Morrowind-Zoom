Description
____________

This mod allow you to zoom in. You can configure mod's behaviour in the Mod Configuration Menu. You can adjust maximal zoom,
zooming speed, and zoom key. You can zoom either by pressing a button (toggle functionality), by holding a button, or using
mouse scroll. You can select between these zoom modes in the MCM. In addition, you can optionally turn on spyglass overlay
which is shown during zooming.

Modify my mod, but credit me as the original creator. If you are a modder looking to integrate this better into the game,
feel free to contact me. I'd like to give a hand, I am also interested in making working binoculars or spyglass with this
script.
